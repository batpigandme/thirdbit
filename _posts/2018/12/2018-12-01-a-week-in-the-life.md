Studying the spread of *nanus hortorum vulgaris* (the common garden gnome).
Let's meet the team:

<table>
<tr>
  <td><img src="{{site.github.url}}/files/robots/lhawang.png" alt="Lhawang" width="100"/></td>
  <td>
    Lhawang, the team lead, has a PhD in ecology,
    and has written two CRAN packages that provide tools for analyzing the geographic spread of invasive species.
    She has been working for the agency for nine years,
    and leading this team for two.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="{{site.github.url}}/files/robots/haddad.png" alt="Haddad" width="100"/></td>
  <td>
    Haddad is the team's gnomologist.
    He also has a PhD in ecology,
    but spent most of his time in the field rather than in front of a computer.
    He has picked up a little bit of R since joining Lhawang's team last year,
    and has learned enough about Git and the shell to get by,
    but still feels like a novice when it comes to computing.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="{{site.github.url}}/files/robots/khadee.png" alt="Khadee" width="100"/></td>
  <td>
    Khadee is working for the team between finishing her master's degree in gnomology
    and starting her PhD,
    in part to decide if she really wants to do one
    or would rather become a data scientist in industry.
    She learned how to build WordPress websites from her roommates as an undergrad,
    and is working through online courses on data science in her spare time.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="{{site.github.url}}/files/robots/bongani.png" alt="Bongani" width="100"/></td>
  <td>
    Bongani is one of the team's collaborators.
    He spends most of his time tagging and tracking gnomes in the field
    and trying to convince angry farmers not to poison the damn things.
    He's handy with electronics, but doesn't know much about statistics or data analysis.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="{{site.github.url}}/files/robots/tiwa.png" alt="Tiwa" width="100"/></td>
  <td>
    Tiwa is probably Lhawang's boss:
    the last re-organization left the matter in a rather quantum state.
    They used to do ecology,
    but their main concern right now is getting and defending the funding the project needs.
    To help with that,
    they need regular updates on the team's findings in PowerPoint-friendly form.
